# Chapter 1 Highlights: Practical Malware Analysis

## Examining Strings in Executables
- Strings in executables are often stored in:
  - **ASCII**: Uses 1 byte per character.
  - **Unicode**: Uses 2 bytes per character.
- Tools like `strings` can help identify text data, terminated by a NULL character.
- Common strings to look for:
  - DLL file names
  - Error messages

## Obfuscation and Packing
- Malware authors use obfuscation techniques like **packing** to evade detection.
- Packed files are difficult to analyze and often lack readable strings.
- Tools like **PEiD** can detect packed executables.

## Linking Libraries in Executables
- **Static linking**: Embeds all required library code into the executable.
- **Runtime linking**: Loads libraries only when needed (similar to lazy loading).
- **Dynamic linking**: Most commonly used by malware authors; libraries are loaded at runtime by the operating system.

## Importing Functions by Ordinal
- Malware can import functions by **ordinal** instead of names.
- Use tools like **Dependency Walker** to identify functions by ordinal values.

## Understanding PE File Structure
- PE (Portable Executable) files contain headers with metadata about the executable.
- Key sections in PE files:
  - `.text`: Code
  - `.rdata`: Read-only data
  - `.data`: Global variables
  - `.rsrc`: Resources
- Tools like **PEview** can analyze PE file headers and sections.
